# Simple Number Plate Recognition

This project performs automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) using OpenCV, EasyOCR, and other Python libraries. The program detects a license plate in an image, processes it, and extracts the text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

## Features
- License plate detection using OpenCV and image processing techniques.
- Text recognition from license plates using EasyOCR.
- Edge detection, contour finding, and masking for accurate plate localization.
- Visualization of processing steps with `matplotlib`.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-number-plate-recognition.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd simple-number-plate-recognition
